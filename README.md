Elixir Tic Tac Toe
===========
To play this version of Tic Tac Toe, you must have both Erlang and
Elixir installed on your computer.

To install Erlang, go to the [Erlang downloads
website](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp)
and download at least version 17.0.

Now you're ready to download Elixir! On a Mac, open up your terminal and
update your homebrew:
```
brew update
```
Then install Elixir:
```
brew install elixir
```
*If you do not use homebrew, or are using a Windows machine, please
consult the [Elixir
website](http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/1.html) for other ways
to install Ellixir.

Once you have Elixir on your computer, you're almost ready to play!
Simply clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/elzme/tic_tac_toe.git
```

Then, from your terminal navigate into the tic_tac_toe directory and type:
```
iex -S mix
TicTacToe.play
```

To run the tests in the terminal, just type:
```
mix test
```
